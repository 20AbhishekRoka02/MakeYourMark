# Contributor Guidelines

## GO THROUGH README.md :nerd_face: 

First read through the [**README.md** file](README.md) which will provide you an *introduction* to this project.  

You can also find the README.md on [this repo's main page](https://github.com/drguthals/MakeYourMark).

## CODE OF CONDUCT GUIDELINES

Do follow [**CODE OF CONDUCT GUIDELINES**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) :monocle_face: when providing *any* suggestions, changes, or views related to issues. 

## Opening New Issues

When you're ready to contribute, **Open an Issue**. Be sure to read through existing issues to see if someone else has opened a related one.

When you open a new issue, make sure you explain what you're proposing to do or suggesting to have someone else do. We encourage conversations about new ideas on this project! 

If you have pictures, you can include those too! These can be screenshots of issues you're running into, screenshots of new designs, or even pics of drawings of new designs!

If you are encountering a bug/issue, be sure to include some information about when you ran into the problem, what the issue was (e.g. include error messages), how others can re-produce the problem, and information on your technical setup (e.g. operating system, versions of libraries, browsers). 

## What to Contribute?

Contributions can come in many forms! You can contribute your own constellations that you created on MakeCode by just linking to the shared project and asking someone in the community to incorporate your constellation into the shared universe, for example. 

You can also contribute new designs of the universe itself!

## How to Contribute?

After you have discussed a contribution in the relevant issue, you can start contributing code! To do this:
1. :fork_and_knife **Fork this repository** *(Option on top right corner, after star button)* 
2. Clone this repo *(to your device)*   
  - By using [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)   
  -> Use command: `git clone https://github.com/drguthals/MakeYourMark.git`

 Once, cloned repo to your device -> Have a tour using :railway_track: **Code Tour** *extension* in VS Code!

#### NOTE:
*When ever you make any changes to code on your local branch and are planning on merging it into the main branch, ensure you have also updated the CodeTour to include your new code!*
