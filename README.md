# Make Your Mark at the Student Zone 2021

Taking part in the Student Zone at Microsoft Build is about so much more than just learning about tools and resources -- it's also about joining a community of other developers and collaborating to produce something amazing! 

To give you the opportunity to show you were there, we've made this stellar MakeCode and JavaScript community project and invite you to make your mark on our Student Zone universe!

This inspired the session [Make your mark: contribute to a community project using MakeCode and JavaScript ](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/9ff3107b-0895-4d3a-a585-09ee14d2d05c?source=sessions) at Microsoft Build with Chloe Condon and Morgan Bell!
